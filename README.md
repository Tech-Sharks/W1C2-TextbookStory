Project #2 for the Tech Sharks Community - Learn to Code with Tech Sharks!

Below you will find the second of our coding challenges!

## Text-Based Story Game

### Overview
The Text-Based Story Game is a Java project where players can embark on an interactive adventure by making choices that shape the outcome of the story. It's an exciting opportunity to practice Java programming concepts such as object-oriented programming, conditional statements, and user input handling.

### Instructions
1. The program presents players with a scenario and multiple choices.
2. Players make their choice by entering a corresponding number or letter.
3. Based on the chosen option, the program progresses the story and presents new scenarios or outcomes.
4. The game continues until players reach an ending or completion point.

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- A Java IDE or a text editor to write and run the code (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ, or Visual Studio Code).

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your Java IDE or text editor.

### Usage
1. Compile and run the `Main.java` file.
2. Follow the instructions displayed in the console to play the game.
3. Make your choice by entering the corresponding number or letter.
4. The program will progress the story based on your choice.
5. Continue making choices until you reach an ending or completion point.
6. To play again, restart the program.

### Example
```
Welcome to the Text-Based Story Game!

You find yourself standing at a crossroad. Which path will you choose?

1. Take the path to the left.
2. Take the path to the right.

Enter your choice: 1

You venture down the left path and come across a mysterious cave. What will you do?

1. Enter the cave.
2. Continue along the path.

Enter your choice: 1

You step into the dark cave, and as your eyes adjust, you notice a glimmering treasure chest in the corner. What do you do?

1. Open the treasure chest.
2. Leave the cave.

Enter your choice: 1

Congratulations! You have found the legendary treasure and completed the game. Well done!

```

### Customization
Feel free to customize the game by creating your own unique storylines, scenarios, and choices. Here are a few ideas to get you started:
- Add more branching paths and endings to create a more complex narrative. (+5 points)
- Implement a scoring system based on the player's choices. (+10 points)
- Include random events or surprises throughout the game. (+10 points)
- Introduce inventory management or puzzles for players to solve. (+15 points)

### Housekeeping
- Good coding practices (+15 points)

### Contributing
In order to submit your completed code, do so in the TechSharks discord server. Do not push anything to the main repository.

Note: The project does not include unit tests. Users are encouraged to write their own unit tests to ensure code correctness and validate their modifications.
